I created a personal chat server called Nerd Chat based on Rocket Chat.

After playing with it for a bit, here is my review:

## Overview

In my personal opinion, the server run quite well, at least for my kind of usage which is non-industrial and non-commercial.

## Speed and Capability

The upload speed of my home wifi is quite slow which caused the Chat client to load very slow if you are in a slow wifi area. But if you change to a faster wifi then it'll load fine. Sometimes, it load very fast depend on how many people you have on the server at the same time. For Pi version I have, which is a 4GB Raspberry Pi 4B+, it okay for 10-20 people on the server at the same time at my estimation.

## Conclusion

I suggest running a Pi Chat server if you have a Raspberry Pi because it quite good to have something called you own. If you want a how-to install the server and run a reverse proxy with your domain, you can head to my tutorial page or [click here](https://guilloutran.codes/post/how-to-set-up-a-chat-server "Click Here")
