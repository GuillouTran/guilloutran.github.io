Welcome everybody to my personal blog! My name is Nghia but my pen name and future change name is Will. I'm a high school freshman and a part-time Full Stack Developer(unofficial, duh!). I enjoy reading and coding. In this blog, I write about my life, philosophy, ocassionally I also write about book and coding. I will also try to write some simple to understand or at least I think is simple tutorial about coding and how-to stuff. I hope you guys will enjoy reading my blog and found it interesting.
